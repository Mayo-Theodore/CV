## Mayo Theodore

I enjoy finding new opportunities to create value, and programming is undoubtedly the best way of achieving this goal!

I am passionate about technology as it allows us to create cutting-edge products and solutions that entertain us, improve the environment and keep us connected. I previously worked as an Analyst in the Client Service team of a Fintech company that created a program used by financial institutions to optimise trading costs. Having the opportunity to learn and work with this technology that solved several real-life applications provided me with an excellent insight into technology's importance to our day-to-day lives.
